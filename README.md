# supply-chain-analysis
This dashboard helps stakeholders move from overall supply chain performance to product-level demand issues and finally to supplier and logistics decisions, all using consistent, SKU-level data.

This dashboard was built to answer one core question:
Where are we making money in the supply chain, where are we losing efficiency, and what should we fix first?

Each page answers that question at a different level:

Page 1: Are we healthy overall?
Page 2: Which products are driving or hurting performance?
Page 3: Which suppliers and logistics choices are helping or hurting us?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 1: Overview Dashboard (Executive View)
This page is a health check of the entire supply chain. It tells you whether the supply chain is performing well overall and where the money is coming from.

It summarizes:

How much revenue we’re generating
How many products we’re selling
How much we’re spending
How profitable we are overall
How much inventory we’re holding
It then breaks revenue down by who is buying, what they are buying, and how products are shipped.


The big numbers at the top show overall performance: revenue, sales volume, costs, profit margin, and inventory.

The charts show what’s driving that performance:

1. Which product categories bring in the most revenue
2. Which customer groups contribute the most
3. Which shipping carriers are most used

-- The SKU and supplier tables help quickly spot:

1. Top revenue-generating products

2. Suppliers with higher or lower profit margins

-- What decisions this page supports
Are we growing profitably or just selling more?
Which product categories deserve more focus?
Are some suppliers clearly performing better than others?

Page 2: Product Insights Dashboard (Product & Inventory View)
This page goes one level deeper into individual products (SKUs). It helps us understand which products are healthy, which are risky, and which need action.

It focuses on:
How much each product sells
How much stock we’re holding for each product
Whether products are slow or fast moving
Whether lead times are aligned with demand
How pricing relates to sales volume and margins


We can see which products sell the most and which barely move.
We compare stock levels with demand to spot:

Overstocked products (cash tied up)
Understocked products (risk of lost sales)

-- The lead time comparison shows whether:

Products take too long to manufacture or deliver
Delays could cause inventory issues
The price vs sales analysis shows whether:
Higher prices reduce demand
Some products sell well even at higher prices

-- What decisions this page supports

Which products should be reordered more aggressively
Which products need stock reduction or discontinuation
Where lead-time delays could hurt availability
Whether pricing adjustments might improve performance

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 3: Supplier Insights Dashboard (Supplier & Logistics View)
This page evaluates how suppliers and transportation choices affect cost, quality, and risk. This page tells us which suppliers and logistics choices are actually good for the business.

It analyzes:

Cost breakdown by transportation mode
Defect rates linked to transportation modes
Supplier-level cost structures
Supplier profit margins vs defect rates
Inventory availability by supplier

We see where money is spent across road, rail, air, and sea transport.
We compare defect rates by transportation mode to understand quality risks.

-- Supplier-level views show:

Who is expensive vs cost-efficient
Who causes quality issues
Who maintains healthy stock levels

-- The margin vs defect chart highlights trade-offs:
Some suppliers are profitable but risky
Others are reliable but slightly more expensive

-- What decisions this page supports

Which suppliers to prioritize or renegotiate with
Which logistics modes increase defects or costs
How to balance profit margins against quality risk
Which suppliers are dependable for long-term planning

How all 3 pages work together (important insight)

We start broad, then zoom in, then diagnose root causes.

Page 1 - Overview Insights tells us where to look
Page 2 - Product Insights tells us which products are responsible

Page 3 - Supplier Insights tells us which suppliers or logistics choices are driving the outcome

This dashboard mirrors how real supply chain decisions are made.
